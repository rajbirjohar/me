            The short version is that I&#39;m an engineer specializing in
            frontend and UX development. I&#39;m currently working at
            Inventives, a venture studio.

          <h2>A Detailed View</h2>
          <h3>Career</h3>
          <p>
            I&#39;m primarily focused on designing, architecting, and developing
            interfaces. Although, I found a strong yearning for building and
            breaking things alot earlier in life.
          </p>
          <h3>Inspiration</h3>
          <p>
            I didn&#39;t really have much direction on what I wanted to be
            growing up. But I do remember enjoying jailbreaking my iPhone and
            pretending to be a hacker with <code>ipconfig</code>. On the flip
            side, I also had an affinity for artistic stuff like drawing and
            painting. To me they seemed like totally different worlds and I felt
            like I had to choose one or the other especially as people kept
            asking me what I wanted to be when I grew up.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn&#39;t until college where I discovered that I could carve
            out my little slice of the world wide web with <code>code</code>{" "}
            <i>and</i> with <span className={css.gradient}>art</span>.
          </p>
          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>
            For my education, I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science
            from the University of California, Riverside.

          <h2>Other Things I Enjoy</h2>
          <h3>üì∏ Photography</h3>
          <p>
            Recently, I started shooting photography after leaving my camera to
            collect dust for a few years. I find myself shooting portraits the
            most as it gives me an opportunity to connect with people and let
            them see how I see them.
          </p>
          <h3>‚å®Ô∏è Keyboards</h3>
          <p>
            I&#39;ve built an unholy amount of keyboards. Way too many. They
            make my job very enjoyable though. I figured if I&#39;m going to be
            coding for the rest of my life, might as well invest in the tool of
            the trade.
          </p>
          <h3>üêé Automotives</h3>
          <p>
            I&#39;m a sucker for a tasteful exhaust note. Feeling the revs
            through the vibrations of the steering wheel stirs up that small
            thrill seeking part of me.
