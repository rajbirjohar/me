            <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>
              I&#39;m primarily focused on designing, architecting, and
              developing interfaces. Most of my experience is founded in React,
              specifically NextJS although I thoroughly enjoy writing CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having only worked six months out of college (at the time of
              writing this), I am barely starting my career in web development
              and software engineering. Although I have taught myself everything
              I know for the past four years including foundational HTML, CSS,
              and Javascript as well as React and Typescript.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recently, I am also dabbling in App development with Flutter and
              Dart.
            </p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
              I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science from the
              University of California, Riverside.

            <h3>üì∏ Photography</h3>
            <p>
              Recently, I started shooting photography after leaving my camera
              to collect dust for a few years. I find myself shooting portraits
              the most as it gives me an opportunity to connect with people and
              let them see how I see them.
            </p>
            <h3>‚å®Ô∏è Keyboards</h3>
            <p>
              I figured if I&#39;m going to be coding for the rest of my life,
              might as well invest in the tool of the trade.
            </p>
            <h3>üêé Automotives</h3>
            <p>
              I&#39;m a sucker for a tasteful exhaust note. Feeling the revs
              through the vibrations of the steering wheel stirs up that small
              thrill seeking part of me.
