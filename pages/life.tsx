          There is more to life than sitting in front of a screen all day
          coding. You can learn about where I&apos;ve gone, what I&apos;ve done,
          and why I&apos;ve done it. I also have some{' '}
          <Link href="/interests">pictures</Link> to go along with it.
        </p>
        <Timeline />
      </section>
