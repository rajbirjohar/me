I recently joined a boxing gym in my neighborhood, and it's been an exhilarating experience. Every session,
I relish the sweat dripping off my face, the burn in my muscles, and the wave of accomplishment that washes
over me post-workout. Entering the gym, I feel invincible, but by the time I leave, lifting my arms seems
like an uphill battle.

The gym is quaint and unassuming - it's really small. With about ten heavy bags, a speed bag, and a boxing
ring, it's the epitome of simplicity. But that's precisely its charm. This isn't a place flaunting luxury
or size; it's a haven solely dedicated to the art and discipline of boxing.

What truly sets this gym apart is the sense of community it nurtures. Everyone, from novices to seasoned
boxers, is united by a common goal: to push their limits and support each other. In all the gyms I've
visited, this is the first where I've felt an integral part of something greater.

At the heart of this community is Coach Pete, a former professional boxer whose expertise is only matched
by his generosity. His commitment shines brightest in his Youth Boxing Program, aimed not just at teaching
boxing skills, but at instilling values like discipline, respect, and diligence. The impact of his work
extends beyond the ring, fostering positive growth in young lives. You can read more on the 
[Chavez Youth website](https://chavezyouth.org/).


However, I noticed a gap in how the gym presented itself digitally. Their existing website was basic -
a few pages with essential information, but it lacked the spirit and vibrancy of the gym. Seeing an
opportunity to give back to this place that had given me so much, I volunteered to redesign their
website, aiming to capture and convey the true essence of our small yet mighty boxing gym.

This journal will go into detail on how I approached this project, the challenges I faced, and the 
lessons I learned along the way. I'll also discuss how I leveraged AI to streamline my development 
process, saving me time and effort.

## Studying the Enemy

Before diving into the design phase, it was crucial to size up the current website - understanding 
its strengths and where it fell short. As I analyzed the site's structure and content, I took note 
of what elements were punching above their weight and which ones were barely staying on their feet. 
The site's visual design, for instance, was like a boxer past his prime - it had the basics down with
its color palette, typography, and layout, but lacked the vitality of a champion.

        <Picture
                    src={home}
                    alt="Chavez Boxing Gym Home Page"
                />

Each page presented itself as a short wall of text, devoid of images or graphics - clear in its 
message but as uninviting as an empty gym after hours. Have you ever landed on a website that 
felt like it was just going through the motions? That was this site. My vision was to transform 
it into a space as engaging and dynamic as a round in the ring, maintaining the clarity of the 
original content but with a visual flair that could draw more visitors.

        <Picture
                    src={contact}
                    alt="Chavez Boxing Gym Contact Page"
                />

While functional, the website lacked the dynamic energy and community spirit that define the gym. Its 
design was outdated, and the content did not effectively communicate the unique values and experiences 
the gym offers. 

        <Picture
                    src={sessions}
                    alt="Chavez Boxing Gym Sessions Page"
                />

A well-designed website isn't just a nice-to-have; it's a heavyweight contender in making a striking 
first impression. To bring more foot traffic to the gym, I knew I had to create a site that was not 
just informative but also engaging - a site that could capture the gym's essence as effectively 
as a well-landed uppercut.

This was my canvas - a plain, unembellished website ready to be infused with the same 
vigor and passion that fills the gym's air.

## Redefining the Ring

With a clear understanding of the current website's strengths and weaknesses, I began the design process.

### Aligning with the Client

The first step was to understand the client's vision and requirements for the website. I knew it had to be 
fast, straightforward to navigate, and accessible across all devices. The design had to be cohesive and 
identifiable, the content needed to be engaging and dynamic, and the site had to be easy to update.

Outlining the client's needs was critical in establishing a clear direction for the project. It helped me 
narrow down the possible tech stacks and tools, ensuring that the final product would be a perfect fit for 
the client and their community.

### The Visual Design 

Next, I had to establish a strong visual identity for the site. I wanted to create a design that 
was clean and modern, but also bold and energetic.

The cornerstone of this visual identity was the color palette. A vibrant red naturally emerged as the 
primary color, reminiscent of the classic red boxing gloves that symbolize the sport's heritage. To balance the 
intensity, I selected a spectrum of grays, creating a grounded yet contrasting backdrop. To infuse 
an element of surprise, I chose an electric violet as the highlight color, adding an unexpected 
burst of energy.

        <Picture
                    src={palette}
                    alt="Chavez Boxing Gym Color Palette"
                />

I had to find a font that would complement the color palette and convey the same energy. I chose 
[Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?query=roboto+slab).  This bold, geometric 
font is not just visually striking against the red backdrop, but its slab serif style also conveys 
a sense of robustness and resilience, mirroring the ethos of a boxing gym.

Already I could see the visual design taking shape - a bold, energetic aesthetic that would 
convey exactly what the gym stood for.

In crafting the visual design, simplicity was my guiding principle. I aspired to create a clean, 
modern aesthetic that accentuated the content without overwhelming it. Liberal use of white space 
introduced balance and contrast, while a consistent and straightforward layout across pages ensured 
a seamless user experience.

<Note>
For larger projects I like to use Figma to create wireframes and mockups, but for this project I 
skipped ahead to designing while developing. It's a risky approach, but I was confident in my 
vision and wanted to get started right away. I highly recommend using Figma or another design 
tool to create wireframes and mockups before you start developing so you don't waste time re-doing 
things.
</Note>

### Navigating User Experience (UX)

With the visual design in place, I shifted focus to crafting an intuitive user experience. The 
goal was to design a site that was not only easy to navigate but also accessible across various 
devices and browsers.

I followed the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) to ensure the site was
accessible to all users. This means that font sizes and colors were carefully selected to ensure 
legibility, and could be used on a variety of devices and browsers.

I went with the familar top navigation bar to make it easy for users to navigate the site. I also 
added a footer with links to the gym's social media accounts and a contact form to make it easy 
for users to get in touch with the gym.

The most important content was front and center so users could quickly find what they were looking 
for. I focused on highlighting the content while keeping the design clean but energetic.

When trying to build a solid UX, it's important to put yourself in the user's shoes. What are they 
looking for? What do they want to accomplish? What's the best way to present the content? These are 
all questions you should ask yourself when designing a website. As a developer, it's easy to get 
caught up in the technical details, but it's important to remember that the user experience is just 
as important as the code. 

## Building the Digital Knockout

The punch of visual design and the agility of user experience were just the start. Now, it was time to lace 
up for the real bout: building the site.

### The Tech Stack

With speed as a priority, I opted to use [Astro](https://astro.build/) because it excels at serving 
static sites. Since this site didn't require frequently updating content, it was as perfect choice to 
keep the site fast and lightweight. It ships minimal JavasScript to the browser so it's still a great experience 
even if JavaScript is disabled or the user has poor connection.

For the Content Management System (CMS), I used [Payload](https://payloadcms.com/), a headless CMS that provides a 
simple interface for authors to manage content. The coaches excel at boxing, not web development, 
so it was crucial to provide them with a straightforward way to update the site's content. Payload's 
intuitive interface, straightforward documentation, and great developer experience (DX) made it an easy choice.

Payload's starter template comes with pretty much everything I needed to quickly get up and running with a single 
command. All I had to do was create a MongoDB Atlas database and connect it to the CMS. 

The original site had a section on healthy recipes that the Coach came up with. That's where the CMS comes into play. 
Now it was trivial to add new recipes to the site. This was a huge win for the Coach because he could now easily 
update the site without having to worry about breaking anything.

Styling wise, I felt most comfortable with vanilla CSS because I prefer sticking to the fundementals so I opted to use 
that instead of a CSS framework (I've got my own thoughts on CSS frameworks, but that's a topic for another day).

I was now throwing punches.

### Connecting the Dots

The final step was to connect the CMS to the website. I created a `recipes` page on the UI and used 
a simple fetch request to pull the data from the CMS. Displaying the data was trivial (but I had my fair share of 
issues. I'll get into that). 

I deployed the CMS on [North Flank](https://northflank.com/) and the UI on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). There 
is a nifty [guide](https://northflank.com/guides/deploying-payload-cms) that I followed to deploy the CMS. 

## (Un)expected Challenges

Stepping into the ring with Astro and Payload was like preparing for a bout with unfamiliar opponents. 
I was braced for challenges, but some still caught me off guard. I was doing okay up until I had to deploy
the UI and CMS (I don't know how devops engineers do it). I had to spend a lot of time re-reading guides and 
documentation trying to figure out where I went wrong.

### Deployment Hurdles: The Devil in the Details

When I first attempted to deploy the UI on Vercel, I initially kept hitting an error saying that the `API_URL` was invalid 
and missing. Turns out, Astro requires any variables to be exposed client side to be prefixed with `PUBLIC`. 
A minor detail, yet it underscored the importance of meticulous attention to documentation. This oversight, though 
it made me feel foolish, was a stark reminder of the basics often overlooked in the heat of development.

The next issue I ran into was with the CMS. The images kept failing to build for a number of small but really annoying 
reasons. For example, I used `pnpm` as my package manager but the Dockerfile was expecting a `yarn.lock` file. The 
`cors` field only accepts strings or string arrays but I was passing in an environment variable which could be undefined.

I was able to finally deploy it successfully, but accessing the CMS became a game of hide and seek with no errors 
in sight. The culprit? A missing `https://` prefix in the public `DNS URL`. Simple? Yes. Frustrating? Absolutely. 
But these are the moments that define the learning process - trivial yet critical, teaching patience and attention 
to the minutest of details.

Navigating through guides and documentation was a time-consuming process, yet it was akin to a rigorous training session. 
Each hurdle, while momentarily perplexing, reinforced an essential skill or piece of knowledge, fortifying my overall 
understanding of these new platforms.

### Embracing the Learning Curve

These experiences, as minor as they were in the grander scheme of web development, were pivotal. They were not 
just about solving problems but about understanding and adapting to the nuances of new technologies. Each challenge 
was a lesson in patience, resilience, and humility - key attributes for any developer (and boxer).

As I overcame these initial stumbling blocks, I realized they were stepping stones towards a more profound 
comprehension of the development process. They prepared me for the challenges that lay ahead, equipping 
me with a more robust toolkit to tackle the subsequent phases of the project.

## The Final Bell

After facing the myriad of issues, the new website is now live, and I'm thrilled with the results. You can check out 
the final product at the [Chavez Boxing website](https://chavez-boxing.vercel.app/). I'm proud to have created a site that
captures the gym's spirit and communicates its values. I hope this website can help the gym reach 
more people and continue to grow its community.

I learned a lot from this project. My key takeways were:

- **Read the documentation.** Seriously. I know new developers hate reading and are eager to jump in the deep end.
I spent a lot of time reading the docs and guides, and it paid off. I was able to solve most of my issues by simply reading.
- **Don't be afraid to try new things.** I had never used Astro or Payload before, but I decided to give them 
a shot. I'm glad I did because I learned a lot from this experience and I can transfer these skills to future projects.
- **Don't be afraid to fail.** I ran into a lot of issues, but I didn't let that stop me. I kept trying and 
eventually figured it out. I learned a lot from my mistakes, and I'm a better developer because of it.
- **Give back to the community.** This project was a great way for me to give back to the gym. I was able to 
use my skills to help them grow their community and reach more people. I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish 
with this project, and I hope it can help the gym continue to grow.

I was able to explore new technologies, tackle into new challenges, and gain a deeper understanding of the 
development process. I'm excited to see what I can build next.

## Punching at Godspeed with AI

On a final note, I felt it was necessary to write about AI and it's impact on this project.

Everyone and their grandma is talking about AI. It's no longer a fleeting trend; it's become a staple in the 
toolkit of modern developers. As someone who's regularly navigated the evolving tech landscape, I've seen 
AI transform from a novel concept to an indispensable asset in my development process. Recognizing its 
potential beyond the buzz, I've incorporated ChatGPT, Copilot, and even Dalle into my workflow, not as a mere curiosity, but as 
a tried-and-true resource for informed decision-making. This isn't about jumping on the AI bandwagon; 
it's about strategically utilizing a tool that's become as common in development as a text editor or a 
version control system.

The traditional route of sifting through endless documentation to select the right tools can be a marathon. 
With AI, I turned this marathon into a sprint. By outlining my project needs, ChatGPT provided curated 
recommendations on tech stacks and tools that aligned perfectly with my objectives. This process wasn't 
just about saving hours of research; it was about targeted, intelligent guidance that cut through the 
clutter of options.

What about actual coding? I had a clear stance: AI was not a coder but a facilitator. As of today, I would 
never trust it to write solid code. Its purpose was to enhance my decision-making process, not to replace the 
human element of creativity and problem-solving in coding. It helped in debugging and provided quick references, 
but the core of the code - the soul of the development - remained human-crafted.

### The Verdict

At the end of the day, it saved me time. Lots of time. Time that I could spend on other aspects of the 
project, like design and testing. But at the same time, it only worked as well as the information I 
provided. The more specific I was, the more accurate the recommendations. It's not a magic wand that 
can solve all your problems, but it's a powerful tool that can help you make informed decisions.

I was able to focus on the big picture, knowing that AI had my back with the details.
