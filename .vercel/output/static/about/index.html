I&#39;m a <strong>UX Engineer Lead</strong> at a venture studio, where
        my sweet-spot is designing, coding and maintaining user interfaces
        amongst other responsibilities.
</p><p>
My tools of the trade are typically Typescript and React and plenty of
        CSS. From micro-interactions to strategically driven visual design, my
        goal is to create interfaces that not only look impressive, but feel
        effortless to use.
</p><p>
I&#39;m an artist at heart and I approach my work with a unique
        perspective. I believe in breaking boundaries and creating the
        impossible.
</p><p>
Although I spend a large proportion of my time coding, what really gets
        me up in the morning is designing visually aesthetic and user-friendly
        interfaces. I find that my affinity for design combined with my
        understanding of the web enables me to create incredible websites that
        work as good as they look.
</p><h2>Experience and Education</h2><p>
I joined my present company in early 2022 where my responsibilities are
        designing and building the front-end of our various concepts. We build
        high potential Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) then spin them off into
        their own successful and independent ventures.
</p><p>
I earned my Bachelors of Science (B.S.) in Computer Science from the
        University of California, Riverside in 2022. During my time as a student
        at UCR, I devised and led the largest hackathon ever held in the
        California Inland Empire. Overseeing a team of ten, and under my
        leadership, this ambitious programming event succeeded in inspiring a
        host of up and coming engineers — something I&#39;m still quite proud
        of.
</p><h2>After Hours</h2><p>
One of my favorite pastimes is photography — I love capturing the world
        around me the way I see it, whether I&#39;m exploring new places or
        simply enjoying a regular walk through downtown.
</p><p>
I recently began playing the bass guitar and now enjoy playing and
        creating music in my spare time. There&#39;s something I find incredibly
        satisfying about the deep, rumble of a bass, and how it allows me to
        express myself in a completely different way.
</p><p>
Finally, I also enjoy taking scenic drives through canyons and other
        natural landscapes. It&#39;s peaceful being surrounded by nothing but
        silence and the open road.
