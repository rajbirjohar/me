Written Nov 6th, 2023</time></header><div class="divider"></div><p>Welcome to my latest endeavor—the “plus one” in an ongoing saga of journaling trials. Consider this the inaugural entry in a series where I navigate the nuances of adulting in the techno-turbulent twenties. This isn’t your typical financial advice column; it’s a transparent window into my own missteps and milestones on the path to fiscal sanity.</p>
<p>I’m kicking off with the green stuff—money. Because let’s face it, financial fitness in your twenties is like the keystone in the arch of life. Get it right, and everything else—from work-life harmony to personal growth—stands a little taller. Join me as I unpack the good, the bad, and the budgetary in the journey to turn cents into stability and dollars into dreams.</p>
<h2 id="the-curious-case-of-credit">The Curious Case of Credit</h2>
<p>I remember asking my mom what would happen if I spent an extra hundred dollars on my first Discover credit card and, you know, paid it off “later”. She replied with a grave simplicity:</p>
<blockquote>“No, never carry a balance on your credit cards.”</blockquote>
<p>That sage advice? I should’ve tattooed it on my forehead.</p>
<p>Credit is a funny concept. It can propel you forward into buying your first home, or it could raze your dreams after a single missed payment. Imagine your future based on a three-digit score that somehow has the clairvoyance to predict your financial trustworthiness. And when you dare peek at your credit score, it gets stage fright and drops a few points, just for kicks.</p>
<p>I underestimated the clout of this little plastic rectangle. I never really understood how powerful it could be, and how dangerous it was with the wrong mindset (hint: mine).</p>

<h2 id="the-illusion-of-financial-escape-artistry">The Illusion of Financial Escape Artistry</h2>
<p>Since being anointed by the credit card gods with my first swipe-able ticket to adulthood, I’ve ridden the rollercoaster of credit scores from the dizzying peaks to the cringe-worthy drops. It was a classic tale of debt, rinse, and repeat. Each time I paid off my balance, I’d victoriously toss my shovel aside—only to pick it up again and break ground on a fresh debt pit. In my own private circus, I was the star clown juggling dollar bills, somehow always surprised when they caught fire.</p>
<p>Here’s the punchline: I’m actually not doing too shabby on the job front. By some metrics, I’m in the financial major leagues—top ten percent of earners for my age in the U.S. I’ve got the diploma, the Computer Science degree, the quintessential tech job. By day, I’m a software engineer; by night, a financial arsonist, setting ablaze my earnings with the same enthusiasm a magician has for flash paper.</p>
<figure class="_figure_13jey_1"><img src="/_astro/shovel.1482d41d_ZvLGNr.webp" alt="The official tool of choice for digging financial freedom tunnels. Or debt graves. User discretion advised." class="_image_13jey_7" width="1792" height="1024" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><figcaption class="_caption_13jey_13">The official tool of choice for digging financial freedom tunnels. Or debt graves. User discretion advised.</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a strange contrast. My bank account sees more code commits than dollars saved, and my paycheck goes up in smoke faster than a pile of autumn leaves. Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t just for the struggling artist or the start-up dreamer—it’s also for the techie who didn’t respect the almighty dollar.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-financial-reckoning">The Great Financial Reckoning</h2>
<p>It was a morning like any other, except, it wasn’t. It was the day my fiscal fantasy came crashing down around me. There I was, on the phone with insurance companies, feeling like a contestant on a game show nobody wants to win, called “Guess How Broke You Really Are.” When Progressive served up a car insurance quote that was more “regressive” for my bank account—a whopping $3,500 yearly premium—I couldn’t even muster $300 to pretend like I could afford it. The weight of my financial choices didn’t just rest on my shoulders; it was a full-blown piggyback ride from a sumo wrestler.</p>
<p>That night after I left from work, I sat down and faced the music.</p>
<p><strong>$26,000 in debt. 😱</strong></p>
<p>The number stared back at me, unblinking, a silent testament to a multitude of swipes, chips, and magnetic strip slides. Devastated doesn’t quite cover it. If debt was a physical presence, it was the over-friendly neighbor that had overstayed its welcome, and now I couldn’t get it to leave.</p>
<p>If you’ve never been in debt before, don’t try it. It’s not worth it. The best way to describe it is like I was being constantly choked by an invisible hand. It was all I could think about. I was trying to see what funds I could rip out of thin air to get rid of that invisible hand. But there was none. That was the simple truth. I had no money and no idea how I was going to free myself.</p>
<p>Yet, being honest with myself about my situation was the first step in tackling this behemoth. Without understanding the full picture, I would be trying to fight it blind without figuring out its weaknesses. That moment was not just a wakeup call—it was the whole alarm clock factory going off. Welcome to reality, population: me.</p>
<h2 id="taking-the-bull-by-the-horns">Taking the Bull by the Horns</h2>
<p>Desperation is a wild beast; it makes you do things you never imagined, like trading a sports car for sensibility. That’s right—I kissed my German-engineered speed demon goodbye and hello to a vehicle that probably couldn’t outrun a caffeinated squirrel. But, this wasn’t just a downgrade; it was a strategic retreat. Swapping out my car sliced my monthly payments down by $500. That’s half a grand that could be wrestling down the debt monster.</p>
<figure class="_figure_13jey_1"><img src="/_astro/squirrel.553c2be5_Z1uKLjz.webp" alt="Squirrel with a caffeine buzz: still faster than my new budget-friendly ride." class="_image_13jey_7" width="1792" height="1024" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><figcaption class="_caption_13jey_13">Squirrel with a caffeine buzz: still faster than my new budget-friendly ride.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, I did something I wouldn’t recommend as career advice: I asked my boss for an advance on my raise. It’s like asking your dentist for a tooth back—it’s unconventional and a tad awkward. But when you’re up Debt Creek without a paddle, you start getting creative. I wasn’t hopeful, but I figured if honesty got me into this mess, maybe it could help get me out too.</p>
<p>My bosses didn’t just hear me out; they took me out—for coffee, that is. Over a cup of joe, I spilled more than cream and sugar; I spilled my guts. The whole shebang. My debts were no longer just numbers; they were stories, fears, a confession of my financial sins. I laid it all out—the mess, the stress, and my fixation with it all, even to the point of considering moonlighting on top of my full-time gig.</p>
<p>In the end, the answer was a gentle, understanding ‘no’. But they gifted me something more valuable than a raise: empathy and advice that was disarmingly simple:</p>
<blockquote>“Do the opposite of what you would normally do.”</blockquote>
<p>It sounded like something out of a financial self-help book that didn’t make the best-seller list, but it was strangely profound. It made sense. Want to spend $1,200 on a camera lens? Maybe not. $2,000 on a new bass? Definite no.</p>
<p>This advice wasn’t a silver bullet, but it was a start—a different way of thinking. And while it didn’t magic away the debt, it began to ease the stranglehold it had on my sanity. Opening up about my situation was like letting out a long-held breath. It didn’t solve my problem, but it did something arguably just as crucial: it showed me that my problem was solvable. Without that candid conversation, I might still be floundering. Sometimes, the first step in tackling the beast of debt is simply finding the courage to say, “I need help.”</p>

Spoiler: It&#39;s not a tropical island.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Confronting a $26,000 mountain of debt needed more than a wing and a prayer; it needed a plan—and a foolproof one at that. I had to be as direct and uncomplicated as possible. Because when you’re tangled in financial quicksand, the last thing you want is a complex rope trick.</p>
<p>I started by grounding my plastic temptresses. All my cards were locked away, sentenced to a boxy prison, out of sight and mind. Next up: the battle plan. A trusty spreadsheet became my war room. On it, I listed my adversaries—the balances, APRs, minimums, and due dates.</p>
<p>I skipped jotting down every latte and impulse buy; that was a level of micromanagement that I’d no doubt rebel against. Instead, I made a pact with my lowest limit card. You know, for essentials (and points—let’s not kid ourselves, points matter). Its meager limit was a built-in budget, whispering “no” to any grandiose spending plans.</p>
<p>I cherry-picked my debt targets, starting with the featherweights for a quick morale boost. Seeing a zero balance was like getting a high-five from my bank statement. Each month, I’d wield my budget card like a financial scalpel, slicing away at the next smallest debt.</p>
<p>I opened up three accounts. One for the quick draws (like those nights out that somehow still happen), one for the steady march of bills, and a high yields savings account where dollars could gather dust in peace. I set up my direct deposit to automatically divert the appropriate amount of money to each account so I would never miss any bills.</p>
<p>The leftover cash was perfectly aligned with my budget card limit. It was like financial Tetris, and I was aiming for that satisfying four line clear. And don’t think I was shackled to the life of a monk—far from it. I still had fun, just responsibly so. I wasn’t cutting out joy; I was slicing off excess.</p>
<h2 id="closing-the-chapter">Closing the Chapter</h2>
<p>There’s a peculiar magic in the numbers now. By month three, the albatross of debt had shrunk to a manageable $17,000. By month four, I was staring at $13,000. And now? I’m doing a victory lap at $1,500. The end isn’t nigh—it’s here, and it’s glorious.</p>
<p>What’s my secret sauce? Well, it turns out that not obsessing over the debt was the best way to conquer it. Who knew? Instead of letting it haunt my every waking thought, I shared my burden. Speaking out lifted the weight of secrecy and allowed me to breathe, plan, and act without the shadow of shame.</p>

<p>Throughout this journey, I’ve become an amateur anthropologist. I study people draped in designer threads, sliding into luxury cars, and I can’t help but wonder—are they the real deal or just fellow travelers on the debt express? This curiosity wasn’t born out of judgment but perspective. It became a financial compass on days when the siren call of a flashy purchase was luring me onto the rocks.</p>
<p>I’m writing this in the hope that it finds you—the person whose heart sinks every time they hear the mail drop, wondering if it’s another bill. The person who thinks they’re alone on this treacherous path. You’re not alone. I’m here, a testament to the fact that it’s possible to sever the chains of credit card debt. If my story can light a spark of belief that you, too, can navigate this storm and emerge unscathed, then these words have done their job.</p><footer class="_pagination_q6lmk_34"><a href="/journals/how-I-build-components-2023-11-05" class="_link_q6lmk_39"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="m12 19-7-7 7-7"></path><path d="M19 12H5"></path></svg>How I Build UI Components</a></footer></article></main><div class="divider"></div><footer class="_footer_1dvkl_1"><div class="_column_1dvkl_8"><small class="_header_1dvkl_11">Rajbir Johar</small><div>UX Engineer</div></div><div class="_column_1dvkl_8"><small class="_header_1dvkl_11">Contact</small><div>hello@rajbir.io</div></div><div class="_column_1dvkl_8"><small class="_header_1dvkl_11">Built With</small><div>🚀 Astro.</div></div><div class="_column_1dvkl_8"><small class="_header_1dvkl_11">Elsewhere</small><span class="_linkwrapper_1dvkl_15"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajbirjohar/">
