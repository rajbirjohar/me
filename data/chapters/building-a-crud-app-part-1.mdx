## Inspiration

It can be daunting as a someone who wants to get into web development.
There are so many different paths to take and so many different technology 
stacks to learn, and well, it gets overwhelming.

But in particular to web dev, you also have the choice to choose whatever you want
to learn to get started and build something amazing. If you prefer vanilla JS, then
by all means, get coding. If you want to learn a framework to speed your work up, then
there are a multitude of options to choose from.

Personally, I've spent the last four years working with React, with a focus on NextJS.
I've only recently picked up Typescript this last year and I am never going back to
Javascript ðŸ˜….

## This Isn't a Another Todo App

Getting right into the meat of things, I thought it might be helpful for me (to ensure
that I know what I'm doing) and you (so you can learn to navigate all the pitfalls) by
writing up a pretty robust tutorial on building a resume worthy crud app.

Given my experience, this app will probably be written with NextJS using Typescript and
Supabase for my backend.

This will go beyond the simple functionality of a plain old list app and will incorporate
some sort authentication, backend management, account and profile functionality, and roles.

Schedule wise, it will probably take me a month or so write up each part and double check
for errors. Hopefully I can stick to this.

## Final Thoughts

The fact that there are so many tutorials out there on how to build out entire apps or
certain parts of apps is wonderful. I love that aspect of web dev where all our knowledge is shared.
That's sort of why I wanted to start this because I wanted to contribute to the knowledge base
that has helped me grow into the developer that I am today.

If you're brand new, welcome. If you've been here for a few years, please let me know of any
bugs I haven't caught ðŸ˜†. Hopefully we can all learn from this.

See you in the next one.
