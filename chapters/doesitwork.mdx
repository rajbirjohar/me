He stretched, allowing his eyes to peer over the open window. The wind was strong as always. A blue and yellow kite in hand, he struggled onto the warm beach underneath him and threw the kite. The kite sliced through the clouds, yanked by the thin string intertwined between his fingers. The seagulls trailed along the boy, splashing through the wet sand. The sun beat down onto his naked back as he reeled his kite in.

The old man dragged his barnacle covered ship onto the sand and followed the footsteps that the boy placed. Inside, he hung the map, now filled edge to edge, on his wall. The blue and yellow kite collected sand and dust near the door. The bucket laid upside down. He sat on the sand throne content and experienced.
