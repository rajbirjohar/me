## Achievements

You know, I didn't think I would make it this far.

Or it's more like, I never really imagined I would end up where I am now. Closing out 2022,
I drove close to 40,000 miles, rediscovered my love for photography, and started my new job.
It's been a wild ride.

Althought, between being struck by wanderlust and viewing the world through a new lens, one part of me
remained constant.

My drive to **create**.

Ten years ago, I swore I would end up as some type of artist,
whether it be fine arts, or architectural. Never did I think about painting with a keyboard. But that's
the neat part. I _am_ able to paint with a keyboard. Hell, I get paid to do it.

But at the end of the day, I'm called an engineer. Funny enough I feel more like an artist than an
engineer. Sure I solve problems and I build features, and I _code_. But I'm also designing interfaces,
and structuring layouts, and _thinking human_.

Still, I am enjoying where I am now. I'm at the crossroads of solving puzzles and bringing ideas to
(what I think is aesthetic) life.

Anyways, 2023 will be here in two weeks and I want to try expressing myself through writing. Even if no one
reads it, I think it'll be good. Plus it'll give me an excuse to rebuild my website for the nth time.
