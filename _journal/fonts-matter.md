I'm a sucker for a good looking font.

Over the many iterations of building my portfolio, I've used many
different types of fonts like the old, reliable [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter),
[Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik), and [Noto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif).
As you can see all of them were pulled from Google Fonts and are free to use.

But I've come to realize that while it's nice to have access to so many free fonts,
it dilutes the individuality that websites have since they all decide to use the same set of
typefaces.

I don't know if the average person truly understands how influencial a font is when it comes to
marketing, brand identity, and overall making the audience feel an emotion. There's an informative
podcast that dives into this on [The Ecomonics of Everyday Things](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/fonts/).

Another appreciation I’ve developed over time is for the design that goes into building a font.
Every curve, kerning adjustment, and capital letter—when crafted well—contributes to a
cohesive message and reinforces the brand being communicated to the audience. It’s this level of
intentionality and craftsmanship that makes me more than okay with paying for unique, well-designed fonts.

Nowadays, I get my fonts from [Atipo Foundry](https://www.atipofoundry.com/), an independent digital typeface
studio. I love how each of the typefaces almost have a personality unique to itself. I highly recommend checking them
out if you are looking for aesthetic legible fonts that still stand out among the thousands of other fonts out there.
