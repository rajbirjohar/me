Recently I've been trying to be more intentional with my time.

I've noticed myself losing hours and even days to scrolling until the witching hour.
This isn't a new problem. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who relate to the
same thing.

Something new I've been trying to counteract this, is by journaling on old, reliable paper.

It's been on my mind for a few months now but only recently have I attempted to stick to it and so far
I think it's going pretty well.

One thing that I kept in mind to help me be consistent in this is trying to make the process of
writing as enjoyable as possible. This means investing in the tools that are required to journal.

I've been a fan of custom mechanical keyboards ever since I started my interest in coding so the
thought process was very similar when deciding what pen and paper I wanted to use.

Fortunately it's a much cheaper hobby.

My current setup (which I don't see myself changing for the near future until I am able to score
a Uniball zento signature) is either the [Uni Pin Pen](https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Pin-Pen-Pigment-Ink-Size-03-0.38-mm-Black/pd/7287)
or the [Faber Castell Pitt Artist Pen](https://www.jetpens.com/Faber-Castell-PITT-Artist-Pen-S-0.3-mm-Black-199/pd/24475)
and the [Midori A5 notebook](https://www.jetpens.com/Midori-MD-Notebook-Journal-A5-Dot-Grid/pd/26421).

The combination of these tools has made writing a sublime experience.

In terms of what I write about, honestly it's whatever. It may be an important memory I want to record. 
It could perhaps just be a drawing of something I found interesting. Just as long as I am creating rather 
than consuming.
