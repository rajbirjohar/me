        <h1>Whoami</h1>
        <p>
          I&#39;m a <strong>UX Engineer Lead</strong> at Inventives, where
          I&#39;m responsible for designing, coding and maintaining user
          interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work deals with Typescript and React and plenty of CSS. From
          micro-interactions to stunning visual design, my goal is to create
          interfaces that look amazing and feel effortless to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#39;m an artist at heart and I approach my work with a unique
          perspective. I believe in breaking boundaries and creating the
          impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I spend most of my time coding, I find great joy in designing
          visually aesthetic and user-friendly interfaces. I find that my
          affinity for design combined with my understanding of the web brings
          out incredible websites that just works.
        </p>
        <h2>Experience and Education</h2>
        <p>
          I joined Inventives early 2022. We are a venture studio focused on
          building high potential Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and spinning
          them off into their own companies. I primarily work on designing and
          building the frontend of our products.
        </p>
        <p>
          I acquired a Bachelors of Science (B.S.) in Computer Science from the
          University of California, Riverside in 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          During college, I led the largest hackathon in the California Inland
          Empire. I oversaw a team of ten to host a collaborative and engaging
          programming event meant to inspire many more upcoming engineeers.
        </p>
        <h2>After Hours</h2>
        <p>
          One of my favorite pastimes is photography - I love capturing the
          world around me the way I see it, whether I&#39;m exploring new places
          or simply enjoying a regular walk through downtown.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recently picked up playing the bass and enjoy creating music in my
          spare time. There&#39;s something I find incredibly satisfying about
          the deep, rumble, and I love how it allows me to express myself in a
          completely different way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I also enjoy taking scenic drives through canyons and other
          natural landscapes. It&#39;s peaceful and calming about being
          surrounded by nothing but open road, and I find that it helps me to
          clear my mind.
