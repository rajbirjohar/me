        <h1>Whoami</h1>
        <p>Hello hello,</p>
        <p>
          I&#39;m a <strong>UX Engineer Lead</strong> at a venture studio, where
          my sweet-spot is designing, coding and maintaining user interfaces
          amongst other responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          My tools of the trade are typically Typescript and React and plenty of
          CSS. From micro-interactions to strategically driven visual design, my
          goal is to create interfaces that not only look impressive, but feel
          effortless to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#39;m an artist at heart and I approach my work with a unique
          perspective. I believe in breaking boundaries and creating the
          impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I spend a large proportion of my time coding, what really
          gets me up in the morning is designing visually aesthetic and
          user-friendly interfaces. I find that my affinity for design combined
          with my understanding of the web enables me to create incredible
          websites that work as good as they look.
        </p>
        <h2>Experience and Education</h2>
        <p>
          I joined my present company in early 2022 where my responsibilities
          are designing and building the front-end of our various concepts. We
          build high potential Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) then spin them off
          into their own successful and independent ventures.
        </p>
        <p>
          I earned my Bachelors of Science (B.S.) in Computer Science from the
          University of California, Riverside in 2022. During my time as a
          student at UCR, I devised and led the largest hackathon ever held in
          the California Inland Empire. Overseeing a team of ten, and under my
          leadership, this ambitious programming event succeeded in inspiring a
          host of up and coming engineers — something I&#39;m still quite proud
          of.
        </p>
        <h2>After Hours</h2>
        <p>
          One of my favorite pastimes is photography — I love capturing the
          world around me the way I see it, whether I&#39;m exploring new places
          or simply enjoying a regular walk through downtown.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recently began playing the bass guitar and now enjoy playing and
          creating music in my spare time. There&#39;s something I find
          incredibly satisfying about the deep, rumble of a bass, and how it
          allows me to express myself in a completely different way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I also enjoy taking scenic drives through canyons and other
          natural landscapes. It&#39;s peaceful being surrounded by nothing but
          silence and the open road.
