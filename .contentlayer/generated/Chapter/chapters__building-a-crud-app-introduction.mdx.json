If you prefer vanilla JS, then\nby all means, get coding. If you want to learn a framework to speed your work up, then\nthere are a multitude of options to choose from.\n\nPersonally, I've spent the last four years working with React, with a focus on NextJS.\nI've only recently picked up Typescript this last year and I am never going back to\nJavascript ðŸ˜….\n\n## This Isn't a Another Todo App\n\nGetting right into the meat of things, I thought it might be helpful for me (to ensure\nthat I know what I'm doing) and you (so you can learn to navigate all the pitfalls) by\nwriting up a pretty robust tutorial on building a resume worthy crud app.\n\nGiven my experience, this app will probably be written with NextJS using Typescript and\nSupabase for my backend.\n\nThis will go beyond the simple functionality of a plain old list app and will incorporate\nsome sort authentication, backend management, account and profile functionality, and roles.\n\nSchedule wise, it will probably take me a month or so write up each part and double check\nfor errors. Hopefully I can stick to this.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThe fact that there are so many tutorials out there on how to build out entire apps or\ncertain parts of apps is wonderful. I love that aspect of web dev where all our knowledge is shared.\nThat's sort of why I wanted to start this because I wanted to contribute to the knowledge base\nthat has helped me grow into the developer that I am today.\n\nIf you're brand new, welcome.
